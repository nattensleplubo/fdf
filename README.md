# Getting Started with Your Fdf Project

## 1. Understand the Requirements:
   - Review the project requirements and specifications provided by Ecole 42. Make sure you understand what is expected in terms of functionality, input/output, and any constraints.

## 2. Set Up Your Environment:
   - Ensure you have the necessary tools installed for C programming. This includes a text editor or IDE, a C compiler (such as GCC), and any required libraries or frameworks.
   - Familiarize yourself with the Minilibx library, as it's commonly used for graphics projects in Ecole 42.

## 3. Parse Input Data:
   - Write code to parse the input file containing height data for the map. The file typically contains rows and columns of integers representing elevation values.

## 4. Render Wireframe:
Rendering the wireframe involves converting the elevation data from the input file into a visual representation of the terrain. This representation typically consists of lines connecting points in 3D space to form a wireframe mesh.

### Steps to Render Wireframe:
1. **Transform Elevation Data:**
   - Convert the elevation data from the input file into 3D coordinates. Each elevation value corresponds to a height in 3D space, and the position of each point is determined by its row and column in the input data.

2. **Draw Lines Between Points:**
   - Iterate through the transformed 3D coordinates and draw lines between adjacent points to represent the terrain. Each point is connected to its neighboring points in the same row and column to form the wireframe mesh.

3. **Perspective Projection:**
   - Apply perspective projection to the 3D coordinates to simulate depth perception. This involves transforming the 3D coordinates into 2D coordinates that are suitable for display on a 2D screen.

4. **Clipping and Hidden Surface Removal:**
   - Implement clipping and hidden surface removal techniques to ensure that only the visible portions of the wireframe are rendered. This helps improve performance and visual clarity by removing lines that are obscured by other objects or outside the viewing frustum.

5. **Color and Styling:**
   - Optionally, add color and styling to the wireframe to enhance its visual appeal. You can use gradients or shading techniques to simulate lighting and add depth to the terrain.

6. **User Interaction:**
   - Implement user interaction controls to allow users to navigate and interact with the rendered wireframe. This might include controls for zooming, rotating, or panning the view to explore different parts of the terrain.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Optimization:** Optimize the rendering algorithm for performance, especially if dealing with large datasets or complex maps. Techniques such as backface culling, level of detail rendering, and vertex buffer objects can help improve rendering speed.
  
- **Error Handling:** Handle errors gracefully, such as invalid input data or memory allocation failures, to ensure robustness and reliability of the renderer.
  
- **Testing and Validation:** Test the wireframe renderer with various input files and scenarios to validate its correctness and functionality. Pay attention to edge cases and boundary conditions to ensure the renderer behaves as expected under different circumstances.

## 5. Handle User Input:
   - Add support for user input to navigate and interact with the rendered map. This might include controls for zooming, rotating, or panning the view.

## 6. Test and Debug:
   - Test your Fdf renderer with different input files, including maps of varying sizes and elevation data.
   - Debug any issues or unexpected behavior that you encounter during testing.

## 7. Optimize and Refine:
   - Optimize your code for performance and efficiency, especially if you're working with large datasets or complex maps.
   - Consider adding additional features or visual enhancements to improve the user experience.

## 8. Document and Present:
   - Document your code thoroughly, including comments and documentation to explain how it works.
   - Prepare any necessary presentations or demonstrations to showcase your Fdf project.

Remember to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks, and tackle them one at a time. Don't hesitate to consult documentation, tutorials, or seek help from fellow students or online communities if you encounter challenges along the way.

Best of luck with your Fdf project! If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
